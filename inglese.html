                <h3>What's a Stock Exchange?</h3>
                <p>
                    A <b>stock exchange</b> or <b>securities exchange</b> is an organized and regulated financial market where securities (bonds, shares) are bought and sold at prices governed by the forces of demand and supply.
                    Securities are categorized into:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Debt securities</b> (bonds);
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Equity securities</b> (common stocks).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    The terms “<b>stocks</b>” is used in US, while in the UK the terms used is “<b>Shares</b>”. The stocks/shares are the parts in which the capital of a company is divided up into equal units. The people who own one or more securities are called <b>shareholders or stockholders</b>, they buy shares because they hope to make a <b>profit</b> if they sell the shares after their value has risen or they can also earn a <b>dividend</b> from the company’s profit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <b>stockbroker</b> is a professional intermediary who buys and sells stocks and other securities for both retail and institutional clients through a stock exchange or over the counter in return for a fee or commission.
                </p>
                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>Shareholders, bondholders and broker face certain risks when they choose to invest in a given company. Those who own stocks in a company run the risk of having <b>share prices with poor earnings</b>. Moreover,<b> if a company performs poorly</b>, it may opt not to issue dividends, thus eliminating a source of income for its investors.</p>

                <p>There are two kinds of markets: <b>Bear</b> and <b>Bull</b> market.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A <b>bear market</b> is when the economy is NOT doing well. If people are pessimistic, believing that stocks are going to drop, they are called “bears”;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A <b>bull market</b> occurs when the economy is doing well. If people are optimistic, believing that stocks will rise, they are called “bulls”.

                <h3>Stock Exchange in the word.</h3>
